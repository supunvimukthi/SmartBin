# SmartBin
Simple python script which was run on raspberry pie to control the input and output for a smart bin. 
Smart bin was utilized with a,  
- **Ulatrasonic sensor to check the amount of garbage filled in the bin 
- Piezo sensor was used to evaluate the weight of the garbage insdie the bin 
- Gas sensor (MQ-35) to check for hazardous gas inside the bin and to notify it to customers through the LCD diplay fixed on the outside of the bin 
- Also a RFID sensor system was used to keep track of the amount of garbage consumed by each consumer.** 
 
Once the garbage bin is full, a notification will be sent to the urban authorities to collect garbage. Also data will be sent to a database and will pulled from there to show on a web site for the use of urban authorities and day-to-day garbage consumers
